## üì¢ News
- [2025/09] Release license obtained. ResNet50 and ablation study code are now available; remaining code will be cleaned up and released soon.
- [2025/06] I presented MDP in a [CVPR 2025 tutorial](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/virtual/2025/tutorial/35921) on Full-Stack, GPU-based Acceleration of Deep Learning and Foundation Models. You can watch the [tutorial video here](https://youtu.be/ktBT_SkrYHU)!

## üìù Introduction

Current structural pruning methods face two significant limitations:
1. They often limit pruning to finer-grained levels like channels, making aggressive parameter reduction challenging
2. They focus heavily on parameter and FLOP reduction, with existing latency-aware methods frequently relying on simplistic, suboptimal linear models that fail to generalize well to transformers

In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing **Multi-Dimensional Pruning (MDP)**, a novel paradigm that:
- Jointly optimizes across various pruning granularities (channels, query, key, heads, embeddings, and blocks)
- Employs advanced latency modeling to accurately capture latency variations
- Reformulates pruning as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP)
- Supports both CNNs and transformers

## üìä Results

Our extensive experiments demonstrate MDP's superior performance:

### ImageNet Classification
- **ResNet50**: 28% speed increase with +1.4 Top-1 accuracy improvement over prior art
- **DEIT-Base**: 37% additional acceleration with +0.7 Top-1 accuracy improvement over prior art

### 3D Object Detection
- Higher speed (√ó1.18) and mAP (0.451 vs. 0.449) compared to dense baseline
